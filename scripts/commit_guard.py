"""Refuse to push commits that carry the wrong identity or tool attribution.

musubi-tier: substrate
expires-when: never — the identity rules in AGENTS.md outlive any model.

The rules being enforced are the branch and identity rules in AGENTS.md.
They are mechanical, so a hook enforces them — "never send an LLM to do a
linter's job".

Why a hook and not care: the harness presets GIT_AUTHOR_* but leaves
GIT_COMMITTER_* empty, so any command that writes a commit WITHOUT the
`-c user.name=… -c user.email=…` flags silently takes the committer from
~/.gitconfig. `git commit` is easy to remember to flag; `git rebase`,
`git cherry-pick`, `git merge --squash` and `git commit --amend` are not,
and a rebase rewrites every commit in the branch at once.

Usage:
    python scripts/commit_guard.py --install   # point core.hooksPath here
    python scripts/commit_guard.py <remote> <url>   # as a pre-push hook

Exit codes:
    0 — every pushed commit is clean
    1 — at least one violation; the push is refused
